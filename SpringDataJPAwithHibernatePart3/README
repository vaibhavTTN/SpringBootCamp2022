Q8. Which method on the session object can be used to remove an object from the cache?
    =>  First-level cache always Associates with the Session object.
        Hibernate uses this cache by default. Here, it processes one transaction after another one,
        means wont process one transaction many times.
        Mainly it reduces the number of SQL queries it needs to generate within a given transaction.
        That is instead of updating after every modification done in the transaction,
        it updates the transaction only at the end of the transaction.
        We can use session evict() method to remove a single object from the hibernate first level cache.

Q9. What does @transactional annotation do?
    =>  Spring creates proxies for all the classes annotated with @Transactional, either on the
        class or on any of the methods. The proxy allows the framework to inject transactional logic before
        and after the running method, mainly for starting and committing the transaction.Any self-invocation
        calls will not start any transaction, even if the method has the @Transactional annotation.
        Another caveat of using proxies is that only public methods should be annotated with @Transactional.
        Methods of any other visibilities will simply ignore the annotation silently as these are not proxied.
